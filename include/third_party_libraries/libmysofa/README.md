# LIBMYSOFA

Our version of libmysofa already compiled for different platforms.

## Getting started

The source code comes from our own fork of the original libmysofa library. In our fork only a few modifications have been made to make it possible to load SOFAs that use the FreeFieldDirectivityTF convection convention.
