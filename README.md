# BRT Library

The BRT library is the core of the Binaural Rendering Toolbox (BRT), a set of software libraries, applications, and definitions aimed as a virtual laboratory for psychoacoustic experimentation. The BRT Library is a header-only C++ library, organised into modules that can be interconnected in different configurations. The library allows the design and rendering of highly realistic and immersive 3D audio, implementing algorithms for audio spatialisation and simulation using headphones.

The BRT library is developed in the framework of the SONICOM project (www.sonicom.eu) and includes the algorithms developed in the 3D Tune-In Toolkit (https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit) in a new open, extensible architecture. The 3D Tune-In Toolkit was developed in the framework of the 3D Tune-In project (http://www.3d-tune-in.eu).


## Additional tools
In addition to this main repository, there are other repositories with associated tools:

* BRT Examples: basic spatialization example implemented in C++ to show how to use the BRT library. Code available at: https://github.com/GrupoDiana/BRTLibrary_Examples 
* BRT Examples for [OpenFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc): only one example for IOS up to now.
* BRT deployment using [Avendish](https://github.com/celtera/avendish): only Simple Listener Model for PureData up to now.
